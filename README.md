# Description
Ammo Extenions is an expansion on [MrCrafish's Gun mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mrcrayfishs-gun-mod) that adds varying ammo types and redefines the reload system.

## Ammo

There are different ammo types which apply different modifiers. There are three types of ammo, basic, advanced, and shell. Bullet damage scales depending on which ammo type is used according to gun mod configuration.

| Accelerator   | Faster bullet travel |
| Puncturing    | More damage |
| Incendiary | Bullets cause fire on hit|
| Fracture | Causes damage over time in addition to regular ammo damage|
| Penetration | Ignores a percentage of armor |

## Magazines

Most guns now require a magazine to fire. The magazines can be loaded by clicking on them in your inventory with a compatible bullet in your hand. (click the ammo then click the magazine)

Each weapon (except for the grenade launcher and missile launcher) has it's own set of magazines that provide bonuses.

Different ammo types can be loaded into the same magazine to provide a range of effects.
